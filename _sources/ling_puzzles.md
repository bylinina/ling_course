# Linguistic puzzles

This page contains linguistic puzzles grouped by topic. I am not the author of these puzzles! I use them in the 'Linguistics for Language Technology' course as a tool for practicing linguistic analysis: inferring underlying rules and structures from linguistic data.



## Puzzle 1: Stress in Muscogee


`````{margin}
Puzzle by Aleksey Pegushev.

This puzzle is linked to the topic of weeks 2 and 3 'Transmitting and capturing language'. Here, you will be given (limited) linguistic data, and your task is to uncover a rule that explains these data. Moreover, the data is unlocked in three portions, each new portion of data challenging your previous generalization. The language this puzzle focusses on is the [Muscogee language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscogee_language), a language that has roughly 5000 speakers and belongs to the Muskogean language family in North America. Presumably, this is a language you don't know much or anything about. That's the whole point! Existing Large Language Models also don't have any knowledge about Muscogee and actually weren't able to solve this puzzle last time I checked. Enjoy! 

### Problem 1

```{toggle}
Look at the following several words in the Muscogee language with stress marked: 

|            |

**Note**: _ł_ is a consonant; the hat over a vowel (e.g. _â_) marks falling tone; vowel length is marked with a colon (e.g. _a\:_).

`````{admonition} Hint 1
:class: tip, dropdown
Count the number of syllables in the first group of words.
`````

`````{admonition} Hint 2
:class: tip, dropdown
The basic rule remains the same, but the second and the third group of words provide data to make it more precise.
`````

`````{admonition} Hint 3
:class: tip, dropdown
In order to formulate this more precise rule, try to figure out what makes word structure in each of the groups unique.
`````

`````{admonition} Solution
:class: danger, dropdown
Nope.
